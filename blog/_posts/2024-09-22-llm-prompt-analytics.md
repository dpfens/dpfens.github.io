In the rapidly evolving landscape of large language models (LLMs), understanding how users interact with these AI systems is crucial for improvement and optimization. However, this need for insight often collides with the equally important requirement of protecting user privacy. This blog post explores an innovative approach to implementing prompt analytics that strikes a balance between these competing demands.

I'll introduce a method that tracks the orthogonal components of user prompts, allowing us to gain valuable insights into LLM usage patterns without compromising the specific details of individual queries. By analyzing combinations of these components, we can build a comprehensive picture of user behavior and LLM performance while maintaining a strong commitment to privacy protection.

This technique offers a promising solution for organizations looking to refine their LLM implementations without infringing on user trust. Throughout this post, I'll explore the conceptual framework, implementation strategies, and potential applications of this privacy-preserving analytics approach.

While embeddings have become a popular and powerful tool for analyzing text data, including user prompts, they come with significant privacy implications that warrant careful consideration. Embeddings capture the semantic essence of text, often in ways that can inadvertently reveal more information than intended.

The use of embeddings for prompt analysis might seem like an obvious choice due to their effectiveness in capturing semantic relationships and their widespread adoption in natural language processing. However, this approach can be invasive, potentially exposing sensitive information about end-users. Embeddings can encode personal details, writing styles, or specific knowledge that, when analyzed in aggregate, could lead to the identification of individuals or the disclosure of private information.

For instance, embeddings of prompts related to medical conditions, financial situations, or personal relationships could, even unintentionally, create a detailed profile of a user's life circumstances. In corporate environments, embeddings might capture proprietary information or strategic plans embedded within prompts. The risk of such unintended disclosures is particularly concerning given the often personal or sensitive nature of interactions with AI assistants.

Moreover, the high-dimensional nature of embeddings means they can capture subtle patterns that users themselves might not be aware they're revealing. This "hidden" information could be exploited through advanced analysis techniques, potentially compromising user privacy in ways that are difficult to anticipate or mitigate.

Given these concerns, it's crucial to adopt an approach that explicitly respects the privacy of end-users while still providing valuable insights for system improvement and user experience enhancement. This is where the analysis of orthogonal components comes into play. By focusing on abstract, high-level characteristics of prompts rather than their specific content, we can gain useful analytical insights while maintaining a strong commitment to user privacy.

The orthogonal component approach allows us to understand user behavior and LLM performance without delving into the potentially sensitive details of individual prompts. It provides a framework for analysis that is inherently more privacy-preserving, as it captures the nature of the interaction rather than the content itself. This method aligns with the principles of data minimization and purpose limitation, key tenets of privacy-by-design approaches in technology development.

In the following sections, I'll explore how this privacy-respecting method can be implemented effectively, providing robust analytics capabilities without compromising the trust and confidentiality that users expect when interacting with AI systems.

{% include components/heading.html heading='Orthogonal Components' level=2 %}

The orthogonal components of a prompt provide a multidimensional framework for analyzing user interactions with large language models (LLMs). By breaking down prompts into these distinct elements, we can gain valuable insights into user behavior and LLM performance without compromising individual privacy. These components encompass a wide range of factors, from the basic intent of the prompt to the level of creativity expected in the response.

* **Intent**: The core purpose or goal of the prompt.
* **Complexity**: The level of difficulty or sophistication required in the response.
* **Ambiguity**: The degree of clarity or vagueness in the prompt's wording.
* **Scope**: The breadth or narrowness of the topic or task at hand.
* **Specificity**: The level of detail requested in the response.
* **Tone**: The emotional or stylistic approach requested (e.g., formal, casual, humorous).
* **Domain(s)**: The field or subject area the prompt relates to.
* **Cognitive level**: The depth of thought or analysis required (e.g., recall, application, evaluation).
* **Persona**: Any specific character or role the LLM is asked to assume.
* **Abstraction level**: How concrete or abstract the prompt and expected response should be.
* **Creativity**: The degree of originality or innovation expected in the response.
* **Subjectivity vs. Objectivity**: The degree of personal opinion versus impartial analysis required.

At the core of this framework is the intent, which identifies the fundamental purpose of the user's query. This is complemented by the complexity and ambiguity components, which gauge the sophistication required in the response and the clarity of the prompt itself. The scope and specificity components work together to define the breadth of the topic and the level of detail requested, providing a clear picture of the user's informational needs.

The tone and persona components offer insights into the stylistic and role-playing aspects of user interactions with the LLM. These elements can reveal patterns in how users engage with AI systems, whether they prefer formal interactions or more casual, character-driven exchanges. The domain component helps categorize prompts into specific fields or subject areas, allowing for a better understanding of the topics users are most interested in exploring.

Cognitive level and abstraction level components provide a deeper look into the type of thinking and conceptualization users expect from the LLM. These elements can help identify whether users are primarily seeking factual recall, complex analysis, or abstract reasoning. The creativity component adds another dimension, indicating the degree of originality users are looking for in AI-generated responses.

By analyzing the combinations of these orthogonal components across numerous user interactions, we can begin to create detailed personas of end-user conversations. These personas represent archetypal users based on their typical prompt patterns, without relying on any specific prompt content. For example, we might identify a "Detail-Oriented Analyst" persona who consistently uses prompts with high specificity, low ambiguity, and a preference for objective responses across various domains.

Another persona might be the "Creative Brainstormer," characterized by prompts with high creativity, broad scope, and often involving persona-based interactions. By recognizing these patterns, product developers can gain valuable insights into how different user types engage with the LLM, informing decisions about feature development, interface design, and model fine-tuning.

These user personas can drive product development in several ways. For instance, if a significant portion of users fit the "Detail-Oriented Analyst" persona, developers might prioritize features that enhance the LLM's ability to provide precise, well-structured responses. Conversely, for the "Creative Brainstormer" persona, the focus might be on expanding the model's capacity for generating novel ideas and engaging in more dynamic, role-playing scenarios.

Importantly, this approach to analytics and persona creation maintains user privacy by focusing on aggregate patterns rather than private details of individual prompts. It allows organizations to make data-driven decisions about their LLM implementations while respecting user confidentiality. As AI technology continues to evolve, this balance between insightful analytics and robust privacy protection will be crucial in building and maintaining user trust in AI systems.

{% include components/heading.html heading='Conversations' level=3 %}

In addition to prompt-level orthogonal components, we can also identify and analyze components at the conversation level. These conversation-level components provide a broader perspective on user interactions with the LLM, capturing patterns and characteristics that emerge over the course of multiple exchanges. Here are some key conversation-level orthogonal components:

* **Conversation Length**: The number of turns or exchanges in the conversation.
* **Topic Consistency**: The degree to which the conversation stays focused on a single topic or ranges across multiple subjects.
* **Depth Progression**: How the conversation evolves in terms of complexity and detail from start to finish.
* **Interaction Pattern**: The rhythm of the conversation, such as rapid back-and-forth exchanges or longer, more deliberate responses.
* **Goal Orientation**: Whether the conversation is task-oriented, exploratory, or social in nature.
* **Emotional Trajectory**: How the tone or sentiment of the conversation changes over time.
* **Creativity Fluctuation**: The variation in creative elements throughout the conversation.
* **Query Refinement**: How user prompts become more or less specific or focused as the conversation progresses.
* **AI Reliance**: The extent to which the user relies on the AI's responses versus contributing their own knowledge.
* **Coherence**: The logical flow and connectedness between different parts of the conversation.
* **Learning Curve**: Evidence of the user adapting their interaction style or understanding of the AI's capabilities over time.
* **Multi-modal Interaction**: The use of different types of inputs or requests (e.g., text, code, data analysis) within a single conversation.

These conversation-level components provide valuable insights into how users engage with the LLM over extended interactions. By analyzing these components, we can identify patterns in user behavior, preferences in conversation style, and the effectiveness of the LLM in sustaining meaningful dialogues.

For example, by examining the Depth Progression and Query Refinement components, we might observe that successful problem-solving conversations often start with broad, exploratory queries and gradually narrow down to specific, detailed exchanges. This insight could inform improvements in the LLM's ability to guide users through complex problem-solving processes.

Similarly, analyzing the Emotional Trajectory and Interaction Pattern could reveal how different conversation rhythms correlate with user satisfaction or productive outcomes. This information could be used to train the LLM to adapt its response style to better match user preferences and optimize engagement.

Importantly, these conversation-level components maintain user privacy by focusing on abstract characteristics of the interaction rather than specific content. They allow for rich analysis of user engagement patterns without risking the exposure of sensitive information contained within individual prompts or responses.

By combining these conversation-level insights with the prompt-level orthogonal components discussed earlier, we can build a comprehensive, privacy-respecting framework for understanding and improving LLM interactions.

{% include components/heading.html heading='Implementation' level=2 %}

Implementing a system to analyze prompts based on orthogonal components requires careful consideration of both technical and practical aspects. While the concept is promising, the execution needs to be efficient and cost-effective. Let's explore a viable implementation strategy that balances accuracy, privacy, and resource utilization.

As noted, training a dedicated model to classify prompts based on the orthogonal components would indeed be a resource-intensive process. The extensive data labeling, cleaning, and refinement required for such an approach could make it prohibitively expensive and time-consuming for many organizations. This method, while potentially very accurate, may not be feasible for teams working with limited budgets or tight timelines.

The alternative approach of using the LLM itself to classify user prompts is more promising, especially when considering the capabilities of advanced models like those offered by OpenAI. The concern about doubling the token usage (and thus the cost) by submitting each prompt twice is valid. However, as suggested, OpenAI's custom schema responses provide an elegant solution to this problem.

Custom schema responses allow us to define a specific output format that the LLM should follow. By carefully crafting this schema, we can instruct the LLM to not only provide the requested response to the user's prompt but also to classify the prompt according to our orthogonal components. This approach effectively kills two birds with one stone, obtaining both the user's desired output and our analytical data in a single API call.

To implement this, we would need to design a JSON schema that includes fields for each of the orthogonal components we want to track. For example, our schema might look something like this:

{% highlight json linenos %}{% raw %}
{
  "response": "string",
  "components": {
    "intent": "string",
    "complexity": "integer",
    "ambiguity": "integer",
    "scope": "string",
    "specificity": "integer",
    "tone": "string",
    "domain": ["string"],
    "cognitiveLevel": "string",
    "persona": ["string"],
    "abstractionLevel": "integer",
    "creativity": "integer",
    "subjectivity": "integer"
  }
}
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}

With this schema in place, we would then modify our API calls to the LLM to request both the standard response and the prompt analysis. The LLM would process the user's prompt, generate the appropriate response, and simultaneously classify the prompt according to our specified orthogonal components.

One challenge with this approach is ensuring that the LLM's classification is consistent and accurate. To address this, we might need to provide clear guidelines or examples for each component as part of our system prompt. We could also implement a calibration process, where we periodically submit known prompts and compare the LLM's classifications to predetermined benchmarks.

On the backend, we would need to set up a system to store and analyze the classification data. This could involve a database to record the orthogonal component values for each prompt, along with analytics tools to identify patterns and trends over time. It's crucial to ensure that this system is designed with privacy in mind, storing only the component classifications without any of the original prompt text.

To further enhance privacy, we could implement additional safeguards such as data aggregation and anonymization techniques. For instance, we might only analyze data in batches of a certain size, or use differential privacy methods to add controlled noise to the data, making it impossible to reverse-engineer individual prompts from the stored classifications.

As we accumulate data, we can begin to create user personas based on common patterns in the orthogonal components. This process might involve clustering algorithms to identify groups of users with similar prompt characteristics. These personas can then inform product development decisions, helping to tailor the LLM's capabilities to the needs and preferences of different user types.

It's important to note that while this implementation strategy is efficient in terms of API usage, it does rely on the accuracy and consistency of the LLM's self-classification. Regular auditing and refinement of the classification process may be necessary to ensure the ongoing reliability of the data. Additionally, as LLM capabilities evolve, the classification schema and process may need to be updated to take advantage of new features or to address any emerging biases or inaccuracies.

{% include components/heading.html heading='Analysis' level=2 %}

Analyzing the orthogonal components of user prompts over time can reveal fascinating trends and patterns in LLM usage. This analysis could provide valuable insights into user behavior, evolving needs, and the overall effectiveness of the LLM. Let's explore some potential avenues for analysis and the trends they might uncover.

### Sequence Analysis
By examining sequences of orthogonal component combinations, we could identify common user journeys or task flows. For instance, we might observe that users often start with low-complexity, high-ambiguity prompts in a particular domain, gradually increasing in specificity and complexity as they refine their queries. This could indicate a learning curve as users become more familiar with the LLM's capabilities.

### Temporal Patterns
Analyzing how component combinations change over time (e.g., daily, weekly, or seasonally) could reveal interesting usage patterns. We might find that creativity and abstraction levels peak during certain times of day, possibly correlating with when users are engaged in brainstorming or creative tasks. Conversely, we might see a trend towards high-specificity, low-ambiguity prompts during typical working hours, suggesting task-oriented usage.

## Domain Clustering
By clustering prompts based on their domain component, we could identify which subject areas are most popular among users. This analysis might reveal unexpected connections between domains, such as users frequently transitioning between seemingly unrelated fields. Such insights could inform interdisciplinary applications of the LLM.

### Cognitive Progression
Tracking the cognitive level component over time for individual users or user groups could show how interaction with the LLM impacts cognitive engagement. We might observe a trend towards higher cognitive levels as users become more adept at formulating complex queries, indicating that the LLM is effectively supporting intellectual growth.

### Persona Evolution
By analyzing how the persona component changes across user sessions, we could gain insights into how users perceive and interact with AI. A trend towards more frequent use of specific personas might suggest that users are becoming more comfortable with role-playing scenarios or are finding particular personas especially helpful for certain tasks.

### Ambiguity and Specificity Correlation
Examining the relationship between ambiguity and specificity over time could reveal how users learn to formulate more effective prompts. We might see a general trend towards lower ambiguity and higher specificity as users become more experienced, potentially indicating improved communication between humans and AI.

### Creativity Cycles
Analyzing the creativity component across user bases could uncover cycles or triggers for creative use of the LLM. This might reveal specific combinations of other components that tend to precede or accompany high-creativity prompts, offering insights into the conditions that foster innovative thinking.

### Tone Adaptation
Tracking changes in the tone component could show how users adapt their communication style with the LLM over time. We might observe users converging on particular tones that they find most effective, or adapting their tone based on the complexity or domain of their queries.

By analyzing these trends and patterns, organizations could gain a deeper understanding of how their LLM is being used and how user behavior evolves over time. This information could drive decisions about model updates, feature development, and user education initiatives. For example, if analysis reveals that users struggle to reduce ambiguity in certain domains, this could prompt the development of more targeted help features or refinements to the LLM's ability to handle ambiguous queries in those areas.

Moreover, these insights could inform broader strategies in AI development and human-AI interaction. Understanding how users naturally progress in their use of LLMs could help in designing more intuitive interfaces or in developing AI systems that better adapt to individual user's growing capabilities and changing needs.

We can extend our focus to compare trajectories across user conversations and between different users. This comparative analysis opens up new possibilities for clustering, similarity measurement, and pattern recognition on a broader scale.

### Cross-Conversation Analysis
By examining the trajectories of orthogonal component combinations across multiple conversations for a single user, we can identify consistent patterns in their LLM interaction style. For instance, we might discover that a user typically begins conversations with high-ambiguity, low-specificity prompts, gradually increasing in complexity and specificity as the conversation progresses. This could indicate a preference for exploratory dialogue followed by focused inquiry.

### User Similarity Clustering
Comparing these conversation trajectories between users allows us to cluster individuals with similar interaction patterns. We could employ techniques like Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to measure the similarity between conversation sequences, accounting for variations in conversation length and pacing. This clustering could reveal distinct user archetypes, such as "Methodical Researchers" who consistently progress from broad to narrow queries, or "Creative Explorers" who maintain high levels of ambiguity and creativity throughout their interactions.

### Divergence Analysis
By measuring how quickly user trajectories diverge from one another, we can gain insights into the diversity of user needs and interaction styles. Rapid divergence might indicate a user base with varied expertise levels or diverse use cases, while slower divergence could suggest more homogeneous user behavior. This information could be valuable for tailoring the LLM's capabilities to support a wide range of interaction styles or for identifying underserved user segments.

### Temporal Cohort Comparison
Grouping users into cohorts based on when they first started using the LLM allows us to compare trajectory evolution over time. We might find that newer users show more erratic patterns in their orthogonal component combinations, while long-term users demonstrate more stable and efficient trajectories. This could provide insights into the learning curve associated with LLM use and inform onboarding strategies.

### Cross-Domain Transfer
Analyzing how users' trajectories change when they switch between domains can reveal interesting patterns of knowledge transfer. We might observe that users who exhibit high complexity and low ambiguity in one domain quickly achieve similar levels in new domains, suggesting effective cross-domain learning. Conversely, consistent drops in complexity when switching domains could indicate areas where additional user support is needed.

### Collaborative Pattern Analysis
For LLMs used in collaborative settings, we can analyze how the trajectories of multiple users interacting on the same project align or diverge. This could uncover effective collaboration patterns, such as complementary query styles that lead to more comprehensive project outcomes.

### Anomaly Detection
By establishing baseline trajectories for different user types, we can implement anomaly detection to identify unusual interaction patterns. This could be useful for detecting potential misuse of the LLM, identifying users who might benefit from additional support, or discovering innovative use cases that deviate from the norm.

### Predictive Modeling
Using historical trajectory data, we can build predictive models to anticipate future user needs based on the early stages of their conversation trajectories. This could enable proactive adjustments to the LLM's behavior or the suggestion of relevant resources to support the user's likely trajectory.

By leveraging these comparative analyses, organizations can gain a much richer understanding of their user base and how individuals interact with their LLM over time. This deep insight can drive personalization strategies, inform product development decisions, and ultimately lead to more effective and user-centric AI systems. Moreover, it opens up possibilities for adaptive LLMs that can recognize and respond to individual user trajectories, providing increasingly tailored and effective support as conversations progress.

{% include components/heading.html heading='Next Steps' level=2 %}

The field of LLM analytics is rapidly evolving, and the approach we've discussed using orthogonal components is just the beginning. As we look to the future, several intriguing possibilities emerge for advancing LLM analytics while maintaining user privacy. Here are some speculative next steps:

1. **Dynamic Component Analysis**: Future systems might adaptively modify the orthogonal components based on observed patterns. This could involve automatically identifying new relevant components or refining existing ones to better capture emerging user behaviors and LLM capabilities.
2. **Multi-Modal Analytics**: As LLMs increasingly integrate with other AI systems (like image recognition or speech processing), analytics might expand to cover these multi-modal interactions. This could involve developing new orthogonal components specific to visual or auditory prompts.
3. **Temporal Pattern Recognition**: Advanced analytics might focus on identifying patterns in user behavior over time. This could involve tracking how individual users or user groups evolve in their interaction styles, potentially revealing learning curves or changing preferences in AI engagement.
4. **Federated Learning for Analytics**: To further enhance privacy, federated learning techniques could be applied to LLM analytics. This would allow multiple organizations to collaboratively improve their analytical models without sharing raw data, only aggregated insights.
5. **Prompt Optimization Feedback Loops**: Analytics data could be used to create systems that automatically suggest improvements to user prompts. This could help users more effectively engage with LLMs while also providing valuable data on prompt refinement patterns.
6. **Emotional Intelligence Analytics**: Future systems might attempt to gauge the emotional state or satisfaction level of users based on their prompts and interactions. This could involve developing new components related to user sentiment or engagement levels.
7. **Cross-Platform Behavior Analysis**: As LLMs become more ubiquitous, analytics might expand to track how users interact differently with various LLM implementations across different platforms or use cases.
8. **Predictive Analytics for LLM Interactions**: Advanced systems might use historical data to predict future user behaviors or needs, allowing for proactive improvements to LLM capabilities or user interfaces.

These potential advancements in LLM analytics promise to deepen our understanding of how humans interact with AI systems, driving improvements in LLM technology while maintaining a strong commitment to user privacy. As always, ethical considerations and transparency will be crucial as these technologies continue to develop and mature.
